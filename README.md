# Color-Detection-using-Python
This repo contains Kmeans clustering algorithm, Color Detection method and image croping method.

# Kmeans Clustering Algorithm
Input is croped image, return is R,G,B values

Advantage: accurate

Disadvantage: Time-consuming

Reference: [K-Means Clustering in OpenCV](https://docs.opencv.org/3.0-beta/doc/py_tutorials/py_ml/py_kmeans/py_kmeans_opencv/py_kmeans_opencv.html)
